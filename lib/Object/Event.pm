=head1 NAME

Object::Event - A class that provides an event callback interface

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.3

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.3';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   package foo;
   use Object::Event;

   our @ISA = qw/Object::Event/;

   package main;
   my $o = foo->new;

   my $regid = $o->reg_cb (foo => sub {
      print "I got an event, with these args: $_[1], $_[2], $_[3]\n";
   });

   $o->event (foo => 1, 2, 3);

   $o->unreg_cb ($regid);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module was mainly written for L<Net::XMPP2>, L<Net::IRC3>,
L<AnyEvent::HTTPD> and L<BS> to provide a consistent API for registering and
emitting events.  Even though I originally wrote it for those modules I relased
it seperately in case anyone may find this module useful.

For more comprehensive event handling see also L<Glib> and L<POE>.

This class provides a simple way to extend a class, by inheriting from
this class, with an event callback interface.

You will be able to register callbacks for event names and call them later.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

In the first version as presented here no special performance optimisations have
been applied. So take care that it is fast enough for your purposes.
At least for modules like L<Net::XMPP2> the overhead is probably not noticeable,
as other technologies like XML already waste a lot more CPU cycles.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<new (%hashcontent)>

This is a convenience constructor. It will create a blessed
hashreference initialized with C<%hashcontent>.

=cut

sub new {
   my $this  = shift;
   my $class = ref($this) || $this;
   my $self  = { @_ };
   bless $self, $class;

   return $self
}

=item B<set_exception_cb ($cb)>

This method installs a callback that will be called when some other
event callback threw an exception. The first argument to C<$cb>
will be the exception.

=cut

sub set_exception_cb {
   my ($self, $cb) = @_;
   $self->{__bsev_exception_cb} = $cb;
}

=item B<reg_cb ($eventname1, $cb1, [$eventname2, $cb2, ...])>

This method registers a callback C<$cb1> for the event with the
name C<$eventname1>. You can also pass multiple of these eventname => callback
pairs.

The return value will be an ID that represents the set of callbacks you have installed.
Call C<unreg_cb> with that ID to remove those callbacks again.

The callbacks will be called in an array context. If a callback doesn't want to
return any value it should return an empty list. All results from the callbacks
will be appended and returned by the C<event> method.

For every event there will also be two other event callbacks called:

Before the callbacks for C<$eventname> is being exectued the callback for
C<"before_$eventname"> is being called.
And after the callbacks for C<$eventname> have been run, the callback
C<"after_$eventname"> is being called.

The C<"before_$eventname"> callbacks allow you to stop the execution
of all callbacks for the event C<$eventname> and C<"after_$eventname">.
This can be used to intercept events and stop them.

If you give reg_cb a special argument called C<_while_referenced>
you can prevent callbacks from being executed once the reference in the
second argument becomes undef. This works by converting the internal
reference of the argument to C<_while_referenced> to a weak reference
and looking whether that reference becomes undef.

It works like this:

   Scalar::Util::weaken $window;
   $event_source->reg_cb (
      _while_referenced => $window,
      disconnect => sub { $window->destroy }
   );

Whenever the C<disconnect> event is emitted now and C<$window> doesn't
exist anymore the callback will be removed.

=cut

sub reg_cb {
   my ($self, @regs) = @_;

   $self->{_ev_id}++;

   my %regs      = @regs;
   my $while_ref = delete $regs{_while_referenced};

   while (@regs) {
      my ($cmd, $cb) = (shift @regs, shift @regs);
      my $arg = [$self->{_ev_id}, $cb];

      if (defined $while_ref) {
         push @$arg, (1, $while_ref);
      }

      push @{$self->{__bsev_events}->{$cmd}}, $arg;

      if ($arg->[2]) {
         weaken $arg->[3];
      }
   }

   $self->{_ev_id}
}

=item B<unreg_cb ($id)>

Removes the set C<$id> of registered callbacks. C<$id> is the
return value of a C<reg_cb> call.

=cut

sub unreg_cb {
   my ($self, $id) = @_;

   for my $key (keys %{$self->{__bsev_events}}) {
      @{$self->{__bsev_events}->{$key}} =
         grep {
            $_->[0] ne $id
         } @{$self->{__bsev_events}->{$key}};
   }
}


=item B<event ($eventname, @args)>

Emits the event C<$eventname> and passes the arguments C<@args>.
The return value is a list of defined return values from the event callbacks.

See also the specification of the before and after events in C<reg_cb> above.

NOTE: Whenever an event is emitted the current set of callbacks registered
to that event will be used. So, if you register another event callback for the
same event that is executed at the moment, it will be called the B<next> time 
when the event is emitted. Example:

   $obj->reg_cb (event_test => sub {
      my ($obj) = @_;

      print "Test1\n";
      $obj->unreg_me;

      $obj->reg_cb (event_test => sub {
         print "Test2\n";
         $obj->unreg_me;
      });
   });

   $obj->event ('event_test'); # prints "Test1"
   $obj->event ('event_test'); # prints "Test2"

=cut

sub event {
   my ($self, $ev, @arg) = @_;

   my $old_stop = $self->{__bsev_stop_event};
   $self->{__bsev_stop_event} = 0;

   my @res;
   push @res, $self->_event ("before_$ev", @arg);

   if ($self->{__bsev_stop_event}) {
      $self->{__bsev_stop_event} = $old_stop;
      return @res;
   }

   push @res, $self->_event ("ext_before_$ev", @arg);

   if ($self->{__bsev_stop_event}) {
      $self->{__bsev_stop_event} = $old_stop;
      return @res;
   }

   push @res, $self->_event ($ev, @arg);

   if ($self->{__bsev_stop_event}) {
      $self->{__bsev_stop_event} = $old_stop;
      return @res;
   }

   push @res, $self->_event ("ext_after_$ev", @arg);

   if ($self->{__bsev_stop_event}) {
      $self->{__bsev_stop_event} = $old_stop;
      return @res;
   }

   push @res, $self->_event ("after_$ev", @arg);

   $self->{__bsev_stop_event} = $old_stop;

   @res
}

=item B<_event ($eventname, @args)>

This directly executes the event C<$eventname> without executing
callbacks of the before and after events (as specified in C<reg_cb> above).

=cut

sub _event {
   my ($self, $ev, @arg) = @_;

   my $old_cb_state = $self->{__bsev_cb_state};

            }
         }
      }

      push @$nxt, $rev unless $state->{remove};
   }

      my $rev = $self->{__bsev_event_forwards}->{$ev_frwd};
      my $state = $self->{__bsev_cb_state} = {};

      my $stop_before = $rev->[0]->{__bsev_stop_event};
      $rev->[0]->{__bsev_stop_event} = 0;
      eval {

   @res
}

=item B<unreg_me>

If this method is called from a callback on the first argument to the
callback (i.e. C<$self>) the callback will be deleted after it is finished.

=cut

sub unreg_me {
   my ($self) = @_;
   $self->{__bsev_cb_state}->{remove} = 1;
}

=item B<stop_event>

When called in a 'before_' event callback then the execution of the
event is stopped after all 'before_' callbacks have been run.

When callend in the main event callback, the event is stopped after
all the main event callbacks have been run.

=cut

sub stop_event {
   my ($self) = @_;
   $self->{__bsev_stop_event} = 1;
}

=item B<add_forward ($obj, $forward_cb)>

This method allows to forward all events to an object.
C<$forward_cb> will be called everytime an event is generated in C<$self>.
The first argument to the callback C<$forward_cb> will be C<$self>, the second
will be C<$obj>, the third will be the event name and the rest will be
the event arguments. (For third and rest of argument also see description
of C<event>).

(Please note that it might be most useful to call C<_event> in the callback
to allow objects that receive the forwarded events to react better.)

=cut

sub add_forward {
   my ($self, $obj, $forward_cb) = @_;
   $self->{__bsev_event_forwards}->{$obj} = [$obj, $forward_cb];
}

=item B<remove_forward ($obj)>

This method removes a forward. C<$obj> must be the same
object that was given C<add_forward> as the C<$obj> argument.

=cut

sub remove_forward {
   my ($self, $obj) = @_;
   delete $self->{__bsev_event_forwards}->{$obj};
}

=item B<remove_all_callbacks>

This method removes all registered event callbacks and forwards
from this object.

=cut

sub remove_all_callbacks {
   my ($self) = @_;
   $self->{__bsev_events} = {};
   $self->{__bsev_event_forwards} = {};
   delete $self->{__bsev_exception_cb};
   delete $self->{__bsev_cb_state};
   delete $self->{__bsev_stop_event};
}

=item B<events_as_string_dump>

This method returns a string dump of all registered event callbacks.
This method is only for debugging purposes.

=cut

sub events_as_string_dump {
   my ($self) = @_;
   my $str = '';
   for my $ev (keys %{$self->{__bsev_events}}) {
      my $evr = $self->{__bsev_events}->{$ev};
      $str .= "$ev: " . scalar @{$evr} . "\n";
   }
   $str
}
